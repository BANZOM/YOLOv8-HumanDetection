Welcome to the YOLOv8 Human Detection Beginner's Repository â€“ your entry point into the exciting world of object detection! This repository is tailored for beginners, providing a straightforward implementation of YOLOv8 for human detection in images and videos.

## Features:

1. **User-Friendly Implementation:** Designed with simplicity in mind, this repository offers a beginner-friendly implementation of YOLOv8 for human detection. No advanced knowledge of deep learning or computer vision is required to get started.

2. **Pre-trained Model:** Start detecting humans right away with our pre-trained YOLOv8 model. The model has been trained on a variety of datasets, created and imported from Roboflow, to ensure versatility in different scenarios.

3. **Minimal Dependencies:** We've kept the dependencies minimal to make it easy for beginners to set up the environment and start using the human detection model without any hassle.

4. **Example Code:** Explore example code and scripts to understand how to integrate the YOLOv8 model into your own projects. The repository includes two Python notebooks:
   - `training.ipynb`: Use this notebook for training the YOLOv8 model on your custom datasets or additional data.
   - `predictions.ipynb`: Utilize this notebook for making predictions and running the trained model on new images or videos.

5. **Model Checkpoints:**
   - `best.pt`: This file contains the weights of the YOLOv8 model at the epoch where it achieved the best performance during training.
   - `last.pt`: Save time and continue training or fine-tuning the model from the point it left off using this file, which contains the weights from the last epoch.

6. **Roboflow Integration:** Easily create custom datasets for training by leveraging Roboflow. Use their platform to annotate images, manage datasets, and export the data in YOLOv8-compatible format, streamlining the process of preparing your own data for training.

7. **Documentation for Beginners:** The documentation provides clear and concise instructions on setting up the environment, running the model, and understanding the basics of YOLOv8 for human detection. Perfect for those taking their first steps into the world of computer vision.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/J3lly-Been/YOLOv8-Human-Detection-Beginner.git`
2. Follow the beginner-friendly setup instructions in the documentation to install necessary dependencies and get the model up and running.
3. Explore the example code to understand how to use the pre-trained YOLOv8 model for human detection and leverage the provided notebooks for training and predictions. Additionally, use `best.pt` and `last.pt` for different scenarios, such as starting from the best-performing weights or continuing training.
4. Utilize Roboflow to create custom datasets, annotate images, and seamlessly integrate your own data into the YOLOv8 model training process.
